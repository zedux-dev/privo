Hi! My name is Davide and this is my final school project for the last year. ðŸŽ“  
It's called Privo and it makes it simple to chat with your family, your friends or co-workers in a new and private way. ðŸ’¬  
The main idea is that Privo messages are disposable because when users disconnect from the chats they lost the messages that were sent, and since no messages are stored by the server, they are lost forever ðŸ˜¬
